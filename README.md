# Ignite Impact

This project is intended to create a matching platform between donors and non-profit organizations to accelerate social impact.

## Stack:
  - React/Redux
  - SASS
  - React-Router v4
  - NodeJS server with Express
  - MongoDB + Mongoose
  - Webpack + Babel
  - mLab

## To start the application:
  -Run "npm install"
  - The DB is connected to mLab, you'll need your own credentials and set them in  a .env file copied from the .env.example. If you want to run the app on a local host, go to /database/db-config and follow comments instructions. Then once MongoDB is installed on your computer, run "mongod"
  - Run "npm start"
  - Run "npm run build:watch"
